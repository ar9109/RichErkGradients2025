# RichErkGradients2025

#This repository contains code, source data, and data sets for reproducing the analysis and figures. 

# Requirements
#This code was developed in MATLAB (Mathworks; version R2023b)
#The image processing pipeline uses TGMM (Amat et al. 2014) to segment nuclei. The version used for this manuscript can be accessed at the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/lxgj9wf2rdrzsnvi7vy38/AH71h_sksydVsYdhNDrULiY?rlkey=2zwyihyigeddqp2q7it14wukf&st=2olmkwrm&dl=0

# Instructions for use
#To run segementation software, download 'raw' data folder, open 'segmentation_pipeline.m' in MATLAB, and execute code. The TGMM software linked above and the 'tgmm_template' folder will need to be installed locally in the same directory as 'raw'.

#To run code for generating figures, load the appropriate '.m' file. (To generate plots shown in Figure 3, load 'fig3.m'. Relevant data sets for Figure 3 are located in 'Fig3' directory.
